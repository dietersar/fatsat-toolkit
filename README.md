While performing several cyber FAT/SAT tests, the toolset needed to be able to perform decent FAT/SAT security tests kept on growing.

These 2 files contain some tools that you can use to perform or enhance your security testing:
- logical => for all logical fat/sat tests
- physical => for all physical fat/sat tests
- general => things that you should always have with you during fat/sat tests

DISCLAIMER - these lists are in no way meant to be able to perform illegal activities - all tools are to be used during well known and agreed cybersecurity FAT/SAT tests - with cooperation of your customer or asset owner.
